# Two-Wheeler-Rental

Ride sharing companies like Uber and Lyft are great business models that provide convenient, affordable and efficient transportation options for customers who want to go to places without the hassle of owning or operating a vehicle. However, with the increasing number of automobiles, riding sharing in cars are not efficient enough especially in crowded and busy areas like cities' downtown. Therefore, bike sharing is a brilliant idea which provides people with another short range transportation option that allows them to travel without worrying about being stuck in traffic and maybe enjoy city view or even workout at the same. In fact, bike sharing programs in the United States started about 15 years before Uber's ride share program started.

My objective of the analysis is to find out the determining factor that drives the demand on bike share rentals, construct statistical models and then try to make prediction on rentals based on the information and models I have. My exploration and the analysis of the data will be performed in R, with a few functions written in C, as per requested.
